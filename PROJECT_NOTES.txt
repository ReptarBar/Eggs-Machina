EGGS MACHINA — PROJECT NOTES (slice 3r3)
=======================================

VISION
Sandbox-first Rube Goldberg builder with a prize-egg theme. Core fun is building contraptions and enjoying both success and delightful failure.

COMPLETED STEPS (to date)
- UX: Hybrid popup + full-page sandbox; floating toolbox layout
- Visuals: Canvas grid background; simple icons
- Storage: 3 save slots via browser.storage.local
- Manifests: MV2 and MV3 with Gecko ID eggs-machina@mellis.thunderbird.net
- Engine: Adapter layer that prefers Planck.js when present, falls back to local physics
- Editor: drag-drop from toolbox, grid snap, selection, rotate (R), delete
- Gameplay: egg spawn, goal sensor sparkle, basic fail crack gag
- Packaging: PNG-only assets, no network calls

REMAINING STEPS (MVP)
1) Replace local fallback with full Planck.js simulation by default
   - Proper rigid bodies for planks and wheels
   - Joints: revolute (hinge), distance (rope), motorized wheel
2) Editor improvements
   - Rotate with on-canvas gizmo; drag endpoints
   - Snap angle guides; undo/redo; autosave
3) Win/Fail polish
   - Prize egg open + confetti; collectible fail reels
4) Options & persistence
   - Persist background choice; toggle grid; sound volume
5) A11y & i18n
   - Keyboard shortcuts doc; ARIA for toolbox; strings module for localization
6) QA & Performance
   - 100+ bodies test; deterministic replay; unit tests for serializer

NOTES FOR THUNDERBIRD
- Use MV2 if MV3 service worker behavior is problematic in early builds
- Game opens in a content tab; PWAs aren’t installed apps in Thunderbird
- No extra permissions beyond "storage" needed
